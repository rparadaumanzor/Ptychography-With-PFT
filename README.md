# Ptychography With PFT
Application of the Partial Fourier Transform (PFT) for the ptychography problem.

In addition to ptychography experiments utilizing the PFT, this repository provides a PyTorch implementation 
of the PFT found in https://github.com/snudatalab/PFT originally implemented in C++.
